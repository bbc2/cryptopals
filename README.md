# Solution to the Cryptopals Crypto Challenges

Challenges: [https://cryptopals.com](https://cryptopals.com)

## How to check the code

```bash
uv sync
make check
```

This will run tests and linters.

The solutions to the challenges are in `test/sets`.

## Why?

To learn more about cryptography and cryptanalysis.

As an exercise, I also applied best practices in software engineering: the code is
modular, type-checked, and most of it is also unit-tested.
